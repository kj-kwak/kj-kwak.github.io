## Bio
As the Senior Vice President, CSO, and CISO at goorm, I lead the company’s strategic direction and information security posture. My leadership is grounded in extensive technical experience as a former threat researcher and intelligence lead.

Previously, I led the Talon Center for Threat Research and Intelligence at S2W and analyzed critical threats against the financial industry at the Financial Security Institute (FSI). I am widely recognized for my research on the "Andariel" threat group (Campaign Rifle) and serve on the National Police Agency Cyber-crime Advisory Committee. A frequent speaker at top-tier global conferences such as Black Hat, PACSEC, and Kaspersky SAS, I bridge the gap between deep technical analysis and high-level security strategy.

## Currently

Serving as Senior Vice President, CSO, and CISO at [goorm](https://www.goorm.io/), leading corporate strategy and global security initiatives.
I am a Ph.D. student at KAIST in the [NSS Lab](https://nss.kaist.ac.kr/), researching network security and automated malware analysis.
